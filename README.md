# Number Fun

A simple one-page app to explore random trivia facts associated with the number of your choice.

Unforntunately, the API for this app has not implemented https and so the app doesn't work on Github pages due to mixed-content being blocked.

It can still be run locally, though. Just clone the repo, and in the project directory run `npm install` (only required once) and `npm start` to launch the application.
